## Main Components

| Component                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IoT Device Gateway                 | Handles communication with IoT devices using various protocols, ensuring secure and reliable connections. Responsible for protocol translation, device authentication, and message routing.       |
| API Gateway                        | Provides a unified entry point for all client applications, handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. Manages access control and serves as the interface for external systems. |
| Data Ingestion & Stream Processing | Manages the collection, transformation, and real-time processing of data streams from connected devices. It supports high-volume data flows for immediate analysis and action.                    |
| Data Storage                       | Implements a scalable and reliable storage solution for both time-series data and structured device information. Optimized for various query patterns and retention policies.                     |
| Analytics Engine                   | Processes collected data to derive insights, identify patterns, and generate actionable intelligence. Supports both batch processing for historical analysis and real-time analytics.             |
| Edge Computing                     | Enables computation at the edge of the network to reduce latency and bandwidth usage for time-sensitive applications, processing data locally and synchronizing with the cloud.                   |
| Digital Twin                       | Creates virtual representations of physical devices to simulate, analyze, and optimize device performance and behavior, enabling advanced monitoring and predictive maintenance.                  |

## Technology Stack

The STAIRS platform is designed to be technology-agnostic, allowing for flexibility in implementation. However, the reference architecture leverages proven open source technologies for each component.

## Integration Points

The platform provides multiple integration points for extending functionality and connecting with external systems:
- REST APIs for application integration
- Message queues for event-driven communication
- SDK libraries for client application development
- Plugin architecture for custom extensions

## Deployment Models

STAIRS supports multiple deployment models:
- Cloud-native deployment on public or private clouds
- Hybrid deployment with edge components on-premises
- Containerized deployment for easy scaling and management
