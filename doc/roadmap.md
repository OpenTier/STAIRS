| Customizable Rules Engine                    | Includes a flexible rules engine that allows users to define custom business logic, triggers, and automated workflows in response to specific sensor events or thresholds, supporting both scheduled maintenance in static setups and dynamic responses in vehicles.             | ❌      |
| Event-Driven Architecture                    | Structures the platform to react to events generated by devices as they occur, enabling efficient real-time processing and integration with automation workflows, which is particularly beneficial for critical alerts in vehicular systems.                                     | ❌      |
| Geolocation & Fleet Management               | Features specialized for vehicle-based IoT, such as GPS tracking, geofencing, route optimization, and remote diagnostics, to monitor and manage mobile assets effectively.                                                                                                       | ❌      |
| Data Privacy & Regulatory Compliance         | Ensures that data collection, storage, and processing adhere to relevant privacy laws and industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), protecting sensitive information from both stationary and mobile environments.                                                               | ❌      |
| Logging & Audit Trails                       | Maintains detailed logs of device events, system changes, and user actions to support compliance, security audits, and debugging, ensuring that every interaction on the platform can be traced back if necessary.                                                               | ❌      |
| Device Lifecycle Management                  | Manages the full lifecycle of IoT devices—from deployment and operation through to retirement—by tracking device status, usage patterns, and maintenance requirements, which is particularly critical for long-lasting static devices and rapidly evolving vehicle technologies. | ❌      |
| Integration with AI & Machine Learning       | Leverages AI/ML techniques for predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and optimizing operational efficiency. This integration supports advanced use cases like predictive maintenance for equipment or intelligent driving aids in vehicles.                                   | ❌      |
